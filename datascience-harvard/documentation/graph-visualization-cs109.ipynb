One of the reason is the famous Ancombe's Quartet, where we have the same statistical overview of the data, but turns out it's a different kind of data when we are trying to visualize it. Similar thing happen when last Russian President Elections, the data that supposed to normally distributed of voters, turns out it doesn't.

The brown color represent when they invade Moscow, and the black color when they returned. You can see how big is the number, begin  at more than 400,000 armies down to 10,000. It's interesting, when they on the way to Moscow, the number of army is decreasing, some because disease, some split. You can see that when in Moscow, not a lot of army dies there. The major death of the armies is the journey itself, and very few return home.This is classic example of Explanation/Communication."

You can see that if you zoom this image, you find block of blacks. That block represent a single person. So he mapped all the death location in London. Soon he found out, that the death approximate the places near water pump. And turns out the water caused cholera. This is an example of Exploration/EDA."

For categorical data, nominal data, you can perform some comparison between each of the category. Either it's the same or different. But for the ordinal,ordered data, you perform any comparison. Ordered data is the same as categorical,but it is ordered, so you can perform greater or less comparison. Quantitative is the data types that we can perform some math calculation in it, acts as a measurement."

If you want to see overall data, use linear scale. This will preserve the exact number of your data. If you want to see some increase/decrease per year, use logarithmic scale. That way you can see when your data are have increase. If it does increase, it calculate overall increase as well as the opposite.Linear scale will at disadvantage if you have some outlier in your data either too low or too high. You won't see much difference if you have too wide gap of the data on the lower value."

Because the right side is too steep, the bottom is too flat. In 1988 published paper, Bill Cleveland, Marylyn McGill, and Robert McGill suggest that in line chart, you might want to use 45 degree of direction change. That way is more distinguishable. For this reason the first chart is the most preferred one."

This chart is good when you want to plot sum of the change of particular variable, separated by category. One alternative way is to use full stack area chart so there are no white spaces. If of course you want to take comparison between each of the category, you may not use stacked and just usual line chart. Once again, depends on your question."

Choosing smaller bin would give you not so detail about the data. While higher number of bin could give more intuitive perspective. But when you have continous amount of data, it's better to use density plots, which is similar look as line plot. The density plots is at disadvantage though if you have smalll number of data. This could  mean that your data is not so many that doesn't seem continuous. You'll end up interpolating your data to make it look continuous, resulting introduce new information that doesn't exists in your data. This could give readers wrong information and misinterpret the data, which is not a good thing."

      "If you have skew data, that isn't normally distributed, it's better to use boxplot. Boxplot has stronger defense against outliers. The reason behind this is because it only take 50% of your data as the most content information, and treating the rest as outliers. 50% of the range is what called Interquartile Range(IQR). The median has more resilience against outliers rather than mean because it only took average of 50% most weighted of your data. That also works when we have Q1 and Q3 rather than standard deviation.
