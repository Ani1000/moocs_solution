      "Earlier in my blog, I said that Data Wrangling is not skill that statistician has. Take a lot of process to clean this data. If there's outliers, two thing comes in mind. First is if this an error in the input. If it was input by human, there's maybe human error. Or sensor error if have sensor, or network error. Second, the outliers that really mean outliers. It's just kind of noise that usually the data has. It's up to us to treat the outliers, or ignore it as we want to focus on the  data.\n",

This function takes 3 things, the data itself, the mean, and the standard deviation of these numbers. Most of the data will split its distribution nicely if we just have these three things.This comes in condition that the distribution of the data follows Normal Distribution. "
