      "If you want to take visualization for more than 3D, it's best to use retinal variables like shapes and colors. But you know that multi-dimensional data isn't just 3D, or 4D. It could be thousands or hundreds of thousands of columns in your data. All of these data have different characteristic. It's important to know that you want your data in the same page, in the same direction, same data type. This way when you're trying to visualize it, you expect to see pattern. Try to manipulate the data so they're in the same group, but not biased. You might also want to check the scales, see if all the data is in the same tuned. Data that are the same page called Homogeneity, otherwise called Heterogeneity.\n",

But Heat Maps without first clustering your data will be just noise in the picture. So you may want to do some cluster first. If there's condition where your data is growing, there won't be enough pixel to take care of it. Instead, based on similarity, you can map three data values into one pixel."

With choropleth, if you have two distinct category for example, you can color the region depending of that particular attribute. This could often a bit misleading, as number of people is not uniformly distributed for each region. So even in most region colored one sided, the other side could still show significant by people in it. The best way to handle this is by making buble size across regions, and color the bubble depending on the category"
