This graph show how the average hours used for mobile device in Indonesia.

**Why it should be fixed**

* It uses a pie chart. It could give users wrong information. We can't compare each of the category. It's difficult to compare each of the pie size.
* It uses rainbow colors. We don't know which color are good or bad.What are the meaning of each of the color, hours alone could differentiate it to category. We don't know if yellow bright, yellow, yellow dark is giving some different information.
* It use almost duplicate colors. for color blind people, they may have some difficulty.

**How to fix this**

* Use a bar chart.
* Use same color, highlight the 5-6 hours if it want to be the focus. As it seems the 5-6 hours is the longest hours.
