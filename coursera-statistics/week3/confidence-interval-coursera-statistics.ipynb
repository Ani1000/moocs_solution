For example if estimate the point estimate, if we guess the exact value chances are we will miss. But if we take range of plausible values (net fishing instead of doing it with spear), there's a good chance that we capture population parameter.Note that sample statistics acts as a point estimate to our population parameter. So if we want to get a population mean, we get a point estimate mean. In this case, the sample statistics and point estimate is synonymous."
