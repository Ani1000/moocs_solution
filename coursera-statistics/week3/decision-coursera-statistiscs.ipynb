That means we only consider one of two side(no matter which side, it applies the same).That means we have to also consider the other tail, eventhough we're not interested for the other side. Why? Remember that **confidence interval is always symmetric**. So, when you cut off and shade the area of 2.5%, you must also consider the area below 2.5%. That's why it often useful to draw the distribution, and shade the area you're interested in. So, **one sided 5% will always be complement to 90% of confidence interval**. Since we're indirectly have to consider 5% for the other side.Since this two method is complement of each other, we have advantage of validating our solution with one another. For example, if you use HT to solve the problem, the problem should be equal complement to if we use confidence interval."
