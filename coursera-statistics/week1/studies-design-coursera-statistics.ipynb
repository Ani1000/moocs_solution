    "Statistic is really a thing to take serious consideration. Evidence that taking from skewed sample is Anecdotal evidence, which assume only very particular cases. It is when generalizing to the mode trend of the data, we can see more generalized summary.Perhaps Anecdotal Evidence can refer back to smoker cases, where people sometimes said that smoking doesn't affect lung cancer. There are perhaps some cases where this might actually true. But the general trend stay strong, smoking did affect lung cancer. Often this evidence is dangerous when one make causation based on observe associated varables. As politics stabilized, rock music gain popularity in a country, considered as association but not causation.\n",

    "We can divide studies into observational and experiment. Observational is when you take a survey and take sample inputs.

There's two clear different between observational studies and controlled experiment. If you can see strong correlation between two variables in observational studies, assume you're doing random sampling, then you can generalize your findings based on target population.If you're doing controlled experiment and you're doing random assignment, you finds that there's strong correlation, you can make causation and generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Random assignment on the other hand perform causation. This must always be done in controlled experiment. With this, we also be assured that all the samples are independent. Suppose for example you divide groups into age, gender, or else. Then you take random sampling and distribute equal number of people to groups that takes treatment vs placebo. Doing random assignment can get you avoid counfounding variables. That way we can have our causation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster sampling is more benefit from the other two sampling, simple random sampling and stratified sampling. With simple random sampling, you don't know which one group that take weight more than the others, for example perhaps when doing SRS you grab more male than female. SRS is blindly sampling without knowing specific conditions. Stratified perform better than SRS as it's first differentiate with conditions. Male and Female can be sampled with equal number. But perhaps cluster sampling is more efficient than SRS. We can have different specific type condition in one cluster, clusters them, and based on one similarity group of clusters, sample clusters from each of the group, and random sample on each of the cluster selected. This way we are more assured of it random.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blinding is an effective method when doing a controlled experiment. For example in research study of pill treatment, people receive blinding so people in treatment group don't get suggested that they feel healthier if they know they receive treatment, or people in placebo group don't feel suggested that they feel sick because they know they didn't receive treatment. This way the study can avoid bias from the people in the results of the experiment, for example in the survey results. Double blinding is also used to the researchers, so they don't whether the pill is treatment or placebo. That way the researchers not doing any bias when analyze the results, e.g. favor treatment group more than the placebo because they wanted to show the effectiveness of the treatment."
