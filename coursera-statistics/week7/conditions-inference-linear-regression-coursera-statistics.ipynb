Hence we reject the null hypothesis and conclude the data provide convincing evidence that the slope is significantly different than zero(we said significantly, if it pass the significance level), i.e explanatory variable is a significant predictor of the response variable."

Small will means the evidence is not convincing to be significant predictor. Two ways to calculate R squared, square the correlation coeffecient, or proportion of explained ratio to total variability, as calculated by ANOVA. We can validate R squared using both methods."
