Looking at parwise plot once gain, we can infer from the correlation coeffecient and scatter plot, that both variables are strong negative correlation. This will bring **multicolinearity** which will disrupt our model. So we should exclude 'white' on this. And that conclusion will bring us to **parsimony**."

    "By avoiding features that correlation with each other, we actually do **parsimony**. The reason to exclude the feature is because it's not bring useful information to the model. **Parsimonious model** are said to be the best simplest model. It arises from Occam's razor, which states among competing hypothesis, the one with fewest assumption should be selected. In other words, when the models are equally good, we avoid the model with higher number of feature. It is impossible to control feature in observational study, but it's possible to control it in the experiment.\n",

    "In the machine learning field, it often useful to exclude those features. First as we avoid them, we also avoid [**curse of dimensionality**](http://napitupulu-jon.appspot.com/posts/kNN.html), which states the learning will take longer exponentially, with huge number of features. So features(predictor) selection is what we're trying to use. It also avoid variance in our model that tend to overfitting, make it harder to generalize to the future problem."
